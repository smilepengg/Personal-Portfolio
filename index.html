                    <p>
                        Hi, I’m Smile! I am currently a second year Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto, excited to specialize in Electrical and Computer Engineering next year!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Throughout the last three semesters, I have been exposed to a wide range of skills such as backend coding (fluent in <b>Python</b> and <b>C</b>), hardware coding (fluent in <b>Verilog</b> and <b>ARM Assembly</b>), etc. Further, I have been able to learn and develop my engineering design abilities, partnering with communities in the GTA to create and validate designs which improves the environment of Nursing Homes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Alongside academics, I have also had the opportunity to develop other skills through participating in events such as hackathons and case competitions, as well as taking a leadership position in clubs and organizations such as IEEE University of Toronto chapter. This has led me to learn more about front-end development (using <b>ReactJS</b>), pitch delivery skills, <b>organizing events</b>, etc.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Finally, I have professional experience as a research assistant in analyzing data using <b>Excel</b>, editing <b>CAD</b> models, and validating circuit boards.

                        <h3>Reroute</h3>
                        <p>
                            Reroute is a system that alerts staff members of unwanted entries made by wandering residents (with Dementia) at the Toronto Fairview Nursing Home. The system utilizes a NodeMCU wifi chip that is embedded within a wearable pin to detect the location of the residents. This is done so by having nearby routers send wifi signals to the wifi chip, which then allows a computer to the coordinate of the resident by using triangulation techniques. Finally, a notification is sent to an user-friendly app if an unwanted entry is made by residents, prompting staff members to redirect the residents.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For this project, I built a semi-functional prototype of the notification app using FramerX. I am currently working with team members to build a functional web application using JavaScript, Python, and HTML/CSS.

                        <p>
                            ParkN is a web application designed to make parking easier, allowing users to find and book parking spots prior to trips. This is simply done by entering a desired parking location and searching for an available parking spot that can be rented around the area. Further, the vice versa is also possible as users can rent out their own parking spots. This project was inspired by the frustration of finding parking spots in big cities and by the many unused parking spots that go unused for long periods of times (such as those who work 9-5 jobs and have an empty driveway).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            ParkN was created at the first hackathon I participated in, StarterHacks. I contributed to the front-end development of the application using ReactJS as well as the pitching of the project.

                        <h3>Women in Science and Engineering National Conference Engineering
                            Case Competition: Walmart Experience Gamification</h3>
                        <p>
                            The case competition was sponsored by Walmart, searching for strategies to engage millennials and young families in store by gamifying in-store shopping. Walmart’s requirement includes making no changes to existing layouts or merchandise, as well as incorporating company values which include its Every Day Low Price, job creation, and environmental sustainability.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The proposed gamification plan is the following: every week, the store releases a list of items where customers gather the items listed. The more items customers buy from this list, the more incentives they gain. For example, 3 items may correlate to a 5% discount off these 3 items, while 10 items may correlate to 10%. Customers will receive instant gratification once they collect an item as the items can be scanned with an on-cart device, which will indicate which items have been collected, and the incentives earned.
                           <br>
                            <br>
                            This system encourages shoppers to interact and engage not just with the on-cart device, but with the Walmart environment in general. Engaging in this system educates the customers about Walmart’s products, and also provides satisfaction when they earn discounts, making them more likely to return.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This was the first case competition that I have won as well as participated in. For this project, I contributed to the development of the prototype including the design of the layout of the screen and the pseudocode that would be used for the scanning component, research, and delivery of the pitch to the judges (Walmart representatives) and other competitors.

                            Engineering Design Competition: Warping Utensils</h3>
                        <p>
                            The focus of the case competition was to create an engineering design that would increase the quality of life of children affected by congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), which is a rare disease that inhibits individuals from feeling pain, feeling temperature, and from perspiring.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The frame chosen for this case study was to create a design that would prevent burns (tongue, palate, and esophagus) when eating hot foods. The proposed solution includes the creation of utensils that have warping abilities, which would make the utensil unusable if the food it is in contact with is too hot. This can be implemented by making parts of the utensils out of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs). Warp time and temperature is “programmable.” Once the food is at a temperature that is deemed safe, the spoon in contact will return to its original shape and can be once again used.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This project earned my team and I first place in the case competition. My contributions includes CADing a prototype of a warping spoon as well as presenting the design to judges experienced in the biomedical engineering field as well as other competitors.

                <p>The following figures demonstrate the background information, such as general information about dementia and values at the Fairview Nursing Home, which was critical to the design process of the project. Further, prototypes of the system (app and wifi chip), as well as an outline of the technical system are presented. Finally, pictures of verification testings at the Fairview Nursing Home are included as well.</p>

After users input their account information, users can then search for a desired parking location area prior to their trip. Once a desired parking spot is selected, users are brought to a payment page to rent the spot.

                <p>The following figures show the engineering design process followed for the project. Starting with framing, the objectives and DFx (design for x) are outlined to describe the overall goal of the project. Then, the solution is presented along with many of its specs as well as a prototype of the screen layout and pseudocode.</p>

The scope was firstly established to focus on the setting of eating for those with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA). Then, the solution, warping utensils composed of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs), is presented along with information about LCEs. Lastly, the overall process and the benefits of the solution is shown to tie all the information together.</p>
